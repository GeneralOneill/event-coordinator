    <h1>About</h1>
    <p id="info_para">JIM, Just for Indecisive Mortals, was created for those mortals, and groups of mortals, who go out without an idea of what they are going to do. Now with this, they can input the number of people in their group and pick a type of activity they wish to partake in. Then JIM will suggest places and activies to do based on the mortal's wishes. </p>
